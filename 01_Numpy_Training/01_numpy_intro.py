Introduction to Numpy
    Numpy is a package designed for data processing, using multi dimensional arrays.
    It is faster than lists, because:
        -It takes a fixed type
        -It takes less bytes of memory.(Faster to Read).
        -No type checking(since datatype in np array is fixed).
        -It allocates contiguous memory (Traversing through memory is faster).
    
    Op Possible in Lists: insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation etc.
    Op Possible in Numpy: lots more :P.
